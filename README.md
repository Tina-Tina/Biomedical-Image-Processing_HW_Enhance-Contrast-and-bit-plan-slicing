Q1: Enhance Contrast 

  Given two contrast-limited images, mri-bright.256 and mri-dark.256, please enhance contrast for both images. Explain your strategy and show your results.

Q2: Bit-plan Slicing and Reconstruct

  Given two noisy images, mri-gauss.256 and mri-ps, please perform bit-plan slicing. Please also reconstruct the images back by using bit-planes (a) 8 and 7; (b) 8, 7, 6, and 5. Compare the image results and state your opinions about the image results.
